# claude-code-super-statusline — Design

A Claude Code statusline that is configured from a **localhost web UI**, built around a
**widget registry** and **user plugins**, with a **zone-based layout** (left / center / right per line).

## Why not extend claude-hud

claude-hud's data layer (transcript parsing, git hardening, context glitch repair, sanitizing) is excellent and MIT —
we harvest it verbatim into `src/data/` (see `licenses/claude-hud.LICENSE`). Its render/config layer is the problem:
elements only merge when physically adjacent in `elementOrder`, sub-segments of the project line can never be
right-aligned, the tokens line is hard-coded outside the layout loop, and labels are baked into i18n strings.
Upstream's CONTRIBUTING scope bar ("two-line default, no onboarding steps, avoid deps") rules out a web configurator.

Claude Code ≥ 2.1.251 now ships `rate_limits`, `prompt_cache`, `effort`, `cost`, `context_window.used_percentage`,
`pr`, `worktree`, `workspace.repo` on stdin, so no OAuth scraping is needed. We stay **local-only, no network**.

## Modes (one binary)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `claude-code-super-statusline render` | stdin JSON → ANSI lines on stdout. Hot path. Imports only `core` + `widgets` + `data`. |
| `claude-code-super-statusline serve [--port 4877] [--open]` | Bun.serve on 127.0.0.1 serving `web/dist` + JSON API. Lazy-imported. |
| `claude-code-super-statusline serve --sandbox` | Same on `:4878` against temp copies of config, samples and statusLine (for UI work and automation). |
| `claude-code-super-statusline install [--replace]` / `uninstall` | Atomic merge into `~/.claude/settings.json` (`.bak.<ts>` backup). Replacing a statusLine that isn't ours needs `--replace` (the panel asks); it is parked under `statusLine.previous.claude-code-super-statusline` (`…claude-code-ssp` before 0.4.0: still read, moved on the next install) and `uninstall` restores it. `uninstall` never touches a statusLine that isn't ours. |
| `claude-code-super-statusline reset [--session ID]` | Baseline the session counters (default: the most recent session; the panel passes the one it previews). |
| `claude-code-super-statusline doctor` | Shows effective config, layer provenance, last captured payload, render timing. |

## Layout model

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "theme": "default",            // name or inline theme object
  "colorLevel": "auto",           // auto | truecolor | 256 | 16 | none
  "colorMode": "thresholds",      // thresholds | gradient — every bar and percentage (Style → Progress bar mode)
  "separator": " │ ",             // between widgets inside a zone
  "columnsOffset": 4,             // cells left free for Claude Code's own footer padding
  "lines": [
    { "left":  [{ "widget": "project.path", "options": { "levels": "full" } }, { "widget": "git.branch" }],
      "right": [{ "widget": "model.badge" }] },
    { "left":  [{ "widget": "usage.windows" }],
      "right": [{ "widget": "context.bar" }] },
    { "left":  [{ "widget": "tokens.session" }],
      "right": [{ "widget": "session.started" }, { "widget": "session.lastReply" }] }
  ]
}
```

* A **line** has three zones. `right` is truly right-aligned to `$COLUMNS`; `center` is centered in the remaining gap.
* Any widget may go in any zone. There is no adjacency rule and no special "first line".
* Overflow policy per line. The right zone never moves — it keeps the end of the first row — and the left side
  (with the center) gives: `truncate` (default) cuts it short with `…`, so every line is one row; `wrap`
  continues it on the rows below, breaking between widgets — it was the default briefly, but left the right
  column with holes on every continuation row. `drop-right` (hide the right zone) still renders for old configs but is no
  longer offered in the panel. Until 0.2.x, `wrap` dropped the *right* zone to a row of its own and `truncate`
  cut the joined line from the end, which hid the right zone.
* A widget that renders `null` simply disappears; separators collapse.
* Claude Code trims every line of the output (`l.trim()`, anthropics/claude-code#29206), so a row that starts
  with padding — a right-only or center-only row — leads with a zero-width `ESC[0m` to keep it (`guardLeadingSpace`).

## Widget contract (`src/core/types.ts`)

```ts
defineWidget({
  id: "context.bar",                 // namespaced, stable
  name: "Context usage", category: "context", description: "...",
  schema: { type: "object", properties: { width: { type: "integer", default: 10 } } },  // JSON Schema → web form
  defaults: { width: 10 },
  render(ctx, opts, api): Segment[] | string | null,   // pure; ctx is read-only
  numeric?(ctx, opts): number | null,                  // enables generic threshold coloring in the UI
  sample?: "Context ███░░░░░░░ 32%",                    // stands in when the session has no data; sizes preset sketches
});
```

An option schema may carry `"x-requires": { sibling: value }` when it only affects the output while
another option has that value (cacheGlyph needs `style: "arrows"`, barWidth needs `bar: true`). The panel dims
it and names the requirement; `tests/option-sweep.test.ts` renders every value of every option — requirements
met — against every built-in sample and fails when an option can never change the output.
`"x-requires-config": { key: value }` does the same for a top-level config key: warnAt needs
`{ colorMode: "thresholds" }`, since the gradient ignores it.

`Segment = { text, style?: { fg, bg, bold, dim, italic, underline }, link? }`. Colors are theme tokens
(`fg muted accent ok warn crit model project git usage context`), literals (`#rrggbb`, `208`, `red`) or `default`
(no colour code: the terminal's own foreground). Every theme maps `fg` to `default`, so plain values stay readable on
light terminals; only accents are coloured.
`api.level(pct, warnAt, critAt)` returns `ok | warn | crit` so every numeric widget gets consistent thresholds, and
`api.levelColor(pct, level, okToken)` turns that into a colour under the user's `colorMode` (the gradient hex, or
`okToken` / `warn` / `crit`). Up to 0.4.1 `colorMode` was a per-widget option; such configs are read as `gradient` if
any widget used it (`liftLegacyColorMode`, config.ts).

## Plugins

`~/.config/claude-code-super-statusline/widgets/*.{js,ts,mjs}` and `<project>/.claude/claude-code-super-statusline/widgets/*`
(or a project's pre-0.4.0 `.claude/claude-code-ssp/widgets/`, under the same trust rule) are dynamically
imported; each module's default export is a widget definition or an array of them. A plugin that throws at load or at
render time is replaced by a dim `⚠ <id>` segment — a broken plugin never blanks the statusline.

**Trust.** Plugins are code that runs on every render, so a project's widget folder loads only when the project is
listed in `plugins.trustedProjects` of the *user* config. `plugins.*` in a project config is ignored entirely (a repo
you just cloned can't trust itself or point at other folders). Skipped folders are reported in `/api/doctor`.

## Config layering

`defaults` → `~/.config/claude-code-super-statusline/config.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CODE_SUPER_STATUSLINE_CONFIG`) → `<cwd>/.claude/claude-code-super-statusline.json`.
A project that only has the pre-0.4.0 `.claude/claude-code-ssp.json` reads and saves that one (`newOrLegacy`): project
files may be committed, so they are never moved.
Objects deep-merge; `lines` replaces wholesale. The web UI shows which layer set each value and lets you edit either.
Config is re-read on every render (cheap: one small JSON) so saves from the web UI apply on the next tick.

The panel edits the *effective* config but saves a *layer*: it replays only the paths changed since the last save onto
the target file (`web/src/layers.ts`), so defaults are never frozen into a file and project values never leak into the
user file. The project is the previewed session's directory (`?cwd=`, accepted only for captured sessions).

## Web UI (`web/`, React + Tailwind + zustand + xterm.js + dnd-kit)

* **Look**: Claude Code's own design language, defined as tokens at the top of `web/src/index.css` — warm
  ivory/slate neutrals, one fixed clay accent (`--clay`, not the edited theme's colour, so focus rings and the
  primary button keep their contrast), serif titles over a sans body, mono for everything that mirrors the
  terminal, and the wordmark: `❯ super-statusline` in mono ("super" in the accent), a block cursor that blinks four
  times and stays, and a hairline in the category colours under the name (`.brand` in `index.css`; the favicon is the
  same prompt and cursor). Sizes are rem on a 110% root (at 100% the page read a size too small),
  so it also follows the viewer's browser font setting; the preview's lines are a step larger still
  (0.9rem, 16px by default). Surfaces are told apart by fill, not borders — page < row (`--row`) < chip
  (`--chip`), two aliases whose order flips with the scheme; outlines are kept for inputs
  (3:1 edges), the sticky header's rule, floating popovers and the clay selection ring. Every text token is
  checked for WCAG AA on every surface; icons are inline SVGs
  (`components/Icon.tsx`). The page reads Style → Layout. Layout starts with the mode: three presets and
  Custom, as cards; the line editor and the tray of unused widgets only show in Custom (lines built there
  are kept aside while a preset is on and come back with Custom). Style is three summaries — theme, bar,
  separator — each opening its choices in place. Rarely used things stay off the page:
  render settings (width, terminal ground, right margin, colour depth, snapshots) sit behind the preview's
  sliders button; repairs, project config, diagnostics and the way out behind the header's ⋯ menu. The
  viewer's own settings are the exception and sit beside ⋯: an EN / 中文 switch (each option in its own
  language, because a page in the wrong language can't be read to find a setting) and an appearance switch
  (system / light / dark, as icons). There is no footer.

* **Preview** = `POST /api/render { config, sample, columns }` → the **same** render engine; output painted by xterm.js
  with a matching ANSI palette on one more filled surface of the page: a small "Preview" label with the column
  count and the settings button, the lines on the row fill, the note under them. No frame, title bar or mock
  prompt (they read as a different app pasted in). The ground is the row fill of the page's scheme unless the
  settings pick a dark or light terminal, which is slightly lower-contrast than pure black or white. WYSIWYG by
  construction.
* **Probes**: an open options panel's one line of current output is rendered against the current sample —
  coalesced into one `POST /api/render/batch` per tick (`web/src/probe.ts`) and drawn in colour (`Ansi.tsx`).
* **Try-on**: hovering a preset card, or hovering/focusing a theme, bar style or separator, previews it
  without saving; the height a try-on grew the preview to is let go 500 ms after it ends. The preview's
  height is sticky during try-ons (a shrinking preview moved the hovered chip away and looped), and the
  "Trying on …" label lives in the preview's label row for the same reason.
* **Samples**: bundled fixtures (fresh session, post-compact null usage, 1M context, no rate_limits, worktree, vim mode,
  Bedrock). `basic` and `post-compact` point at bundled sample transcripts whose timestamps are seconds relative to
  now; `src/core/fixtures.ts` writes a real copy with ISO times, so agents, todos, tools, MCP, output speed and
  compactions preview as if live.
  Plus **live captures**: `render` persists the last stdin payload per `session_id` to `<data>/samples/` (throttled), so
  you preview against your real session. Live samples are shown exactly as captured — no synthetic values.
  There is no data picker: `/super-statusline:config` opens the page as `?session=$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, and the preview
  shows that session; if it hasn't been captured yet, the most recent live session; with none, the first fixture
  (`pickSample` in `web/src/store.ts`).
* **Tray**: every widget not in the layout sits under it, one group per row. Groups gather related categories
  (project + git, model + context, usage + tokens + cost…) because the tray only lists unused widgets and a
  narrow category was often down to one item; a group still left with one joins "Other" (`custom.*` stay after use — they are
  meant to be placed several times). Click one to append it to the last line (focus moves to the new chip), drag it
  into any zone, or drag a placed chip back onto the tray to remove it; hovering one shows a tooltip with its
  description and sample output (it used to redraw the preview for every item the pointer crossed). The
  tray replaced a "+" in every zone and a picker drawer. Drag widgets between zones and lines, or move them with
  Alt+Arrow keys; Delete removes a focused chip.
* **Options open in place**: clicking a chip unfolds its options under its own line (the line and the panel read as
  one card) — it replaced a side drawer that dimmed the page. The form is generated from the widget's JSON Schema
  by kind: enums as a row of choices, every boolean in one group of toggles, `warnAt` + `critAt` as one threshold
  band, colour as swatches, bold as one more toggle (the raw JSON is in Diagnostics → Config JSON). Hovering a value leaves the preview alone (a
  statusline changing under the pointer while reading was distracting); a click applies, and
  the panel keeps one line of what the widget prints now.
* **Install**: the first save auto-applies unless another tool's statusLine is set — then the server answers 409 and
  the panel asks. *⋯ menu → Stop using this statusline* (two steps: it first says what comes back) restores the previous one.
  A statusLine that still runs the pre-0.4.0 `ssp` plugin (`…/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/ssp/…`) counts as ours, and
  the configurator repoints it at itself when it starts from a plugin install (`adoptLegacyStatusLine`), so upgrading is
  "install the renamed plugin, open the configurator once". A statusLine aimed at a checkout is never taken over.
* **i18n**: typed message objects (`web/src/i18n`), English and 简体中文, browser-detected with a switcher.
* **Security**: see `src/server/guard.ts` — own Host/Origin only, no CORS, JSON-only writes, 1 MB cap.
* **Shipping**: `web/dist` is committed (marketplace installs run it as-is), stamped with a hash of its sources;
  `tests/web-dist.test.ts` fails when it is stale.

## Performance budget

Claude Code debounces at 300 ms and kills in-flight scripts. Target **< 40 ms warm** for `render`:
* no UI/server imports on the render path (separate entry, lazy `import()` for `serve`);
* the transcript is parsed **incrementally** from a saved byte offset (a full parse only when the file was truncated or
  replaced), so a new message costs the same on a 100 MB transcript as on a small one;
* git/jj calls run in parallel under a ~200 ms deadline. On a miss the render uses the last cached status and a
  detached helper (`src/core/vcs-refresh.ts`, one per repo via a lock file) finishes the work for the next render.
  The cache honours `git.cacheMs` and is invalidated by `.git/HEAD` / `.git/index` changes;
* `render` exits as soon as stdout is flushed — nothing lingering keeps Claude Code waiting;
* output speed is measured from the transcript tail (latest response: output tokens ÷ request→last entry), not from
  consecutive renders — Claude Code re-runs the statusline per message, not while a response streams;
* `tests/render-budget.test.ts` times the whole CLI (startup included), not just `render()`.

## Data root

`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/plugins/claude-code-super-statusline/` (defaults to `~/.claude/plugins/claude-code-super-statusline/`):
transcript-cache, context-cache, config-cache, samples. Files 0600, dirs 0700, temp+rename writes (inherited conventions).

**Folders from before 0.4.0** (`claude-code-ssp`, for this data root and for `~/.config/…`) are moved to the new name the
first time they are looked up (`adoptLegacyDir` in `src/data/app-name.ts`): a single rename between siblings, so nothing
is half-moved; if the rename fails the old folder stays in use rather than the user starting over from defaults.
`serve --sandbox` turns the move off (`freezeLegacyDirs`): it only reads the real folders, and an older install may still
be the live statusline.
