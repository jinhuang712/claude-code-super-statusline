the real one, running on a sample session</p>

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinhuang712/claude-code-super-statusline/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then run `/super-statusline:config` in Claude Code and pick a layout. The script checks for [Bun](https://bun.sh)
(and offers to install it); run it again any time to update. Installing by hand, uninstalling and upgrading:
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Drag and drop

Start from a preset, then arrange it by hand — the preview redraws as you go:

* **Drag a widget** from *Unused widgets* onto any line, left or right.
* **Drag it again** to reorder it, or to move it to another line — or focus it and press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + arrow keys.
* **Drag it back** to the tray to remove it (or click it and choose *Remove from statusline*).

  <img alt="The configurator: a live preview of the statusline, Style (theme, bar glyphs, progress bar mode, separator) and Layout presets" src="docs/images/configurator-dark.png">
</picture>

* **Layout** — *Minimal*, *Standard* or *Full*, or *Custom* to build your own lines by dragging.
* **Color theme** — default, nord, dracula, gruvbox, tokyo-night, catppuccin, mono.
* **Progress bars** — the bar glyphs: full block, tall, low, half, slanted, squares, line, dots.
* **Progress bar mode** — thresholds (green → yellow → red) or a smooth gradient.
* **Separator** — `│` `·` `•` `/` `|` `❯`, or your own.
* **Each widget** — in *Custom*, click a widget to change its label, colour and options:

The preview shows your real session; hover a choice to try it before you click. English and 简体中文.
